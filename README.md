To anyone who might read this,

Hii this is Rosemary Liu from BIT.

I'm a Computer Science major student and I'm taking the course Data Structure and ALgorithm Analysis this fall. As almost a greenhand, I'm posting my homework codes in 
this repertoire and I hope some time later, maybe several months or a year, when I look back at these codes I will find myself having made huge progress. If you have 
any advice on improving my algorithms or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me! 


Best regards,
Rosemary
