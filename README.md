To anyone who might read this,

Hi this is Rosemary Liu from BIT.

I'm a Computer Science major student and I'm taking the course Data Structure and ALgorithm Analysis this fall. As almost a greenhand, I'm posting my homework 
codes in this repertoire and I hope some time later, maybe several months or a year, when I look back at these codes I will find myself having made huge progress.
Since I am a newcomer at Github, I may sometimes get the format a mess, so apologies first.

If you have any advice on improving my algorithms or if you have any questions when reading my codes, please feel free to contact me! I hope together we can 
make progress at Github.


Best regards,
Rosemary
